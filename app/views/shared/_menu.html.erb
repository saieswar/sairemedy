          <p>Astrology sees mankind as being not only influenced by hereditary factors and

            the environment, but also by the state of our solar system at the moment of birth. 

            The planets are regarded as basic life-forces, the tools we live by as well as the 

            basis of our very substance. These planetary forces take on different forms, 

            depending on their zodiacal position and on the way they relate to one another.
          </p>

          <p>The aspects formed between the planets describe 

            these relationships, the positions of the planets in 

            relation to the place of birth tell us of their expression 

            in the spheres of life depicted by the astrological 

            houses.
          </p>

          <p>By interpreting the roles of these players (the planets) and their qualities (the 

            elements, signs and houses) and creating a synthesis, astrology is able to 

            present a complete and comprehensive picture of the person and his potential, 

            based on the natal horoscope.

          <p>Numerology is another modern method of divination, one whot attempts to  discern the occult significance of numbers. It too is a popular form of entertainment. Like palmistry, numerology is thousands of years old and strongly associated with the occult. The practice of using tarot cards and the cabala are rooted in numerology, and astrology also bears a relationship. Numerologists claim to offer the following information or advice: choosing the correct marriage partner, vocation, city, or house in which to live; individual “compatibility” with the products one uses; understanding one’s mate and friends better; when to buy property or invest in a business; the best days to take a trip, apply for a new job, start a new venture, have surgery, and so on.

        <div class="modal-body">
          <p>VAASTU SHASTRA is an ancient Hindu practice which tells us how to  

            construct buildings in harmony with natural forces for the  well being of 

            an individual as well as  humanity as a whole. This precious  Hindu 

            philosophy forms the the basis of  the  traditional Indian system of 

            architecture.  Vaastu literally means the dwelling place. The rules of 

            Vaastu are derived from 'Vaastu Purusha' who is depicted as a man lying 

            with his head pointing northeast, in a grid of usually 64 squares. The 

            different parts and directions are assigned to different Gods and 

            Guardians. The 'Vaastu Purusha' is said to be the spirit of the site.  

            Aesthetically correct dimensions of rooms, doors windows and even the 

            structural parts like plinth and pillars can be determined on the concept of 

            ‘Vaastu Purusha’. Vastu Purusha is described at the-end.
          </p>

          <p> The purpose of the vaastu  of  Vaastu shastra is to provide 

            guidelines for proper construction of houses, shops, commercial buildings 

            with brand name stores and   operating offices etc. Vaastu determines the 

            position of the house with regard to points of a compass and suggests the 

            points to keep in mind with respect to  buildings, lines, directions, skylines, 

            elongations, levels, slopes, water (underground and overhead), kitchen, 

            bedrooms, toilets, staircase, heights of ceilings and roofs, entrances, 

            location of doors and windows, compound walls etc.
          </p>

          <p>The importance of Vaastu shastra lies in the fact that it is a result-

            oriented science and gives desired results if applied properly. Vaastu 

            shastra suggests ways in which we can live in tune with the laws of nature, 

            so that we can be healthy, peaceful and efficiently and prosperous.
          </p>  

          <p> We can describe some ideal situations of houses and buildings 

            according to VastuShastra.  According to this science, an ideal plot should 

            be a square. Its  all four sides are straight and equal in length and it has 

            equal angle of 90 degree at all four corners. Square is the best shape of a 

            plot.   A rectangular plot having its length not more that double the 

            breadth (length and breadth ratio not more than 1:2) is also a good plot. 

            While selecting a plot,  geographical surroundings & level of the land and 

            roads around the plot must given due importance.
          </p>



          <p>Direction of a plot can be determined by  using a magnetic 

            compass. It is a device for finding direction. It has a freely moving needle 

            which always points to the magnetic North. Make two lines crossing each 

            other dividing a paper in four equal parts at 90-degree angle. Place a 

            compass on paper in the middle of your plot and align it with two lines in 

            the North and the South of the needle of the compass.
          </p>

          <p>Extend these lines on the plot and mark it to have exact direction.
          </p>

          <p> The size of length, breadth  both effect the fortune of the person who lives 

            in it.  The Southwest portion of the house is meant for bedroom for adults. 

            It may be located in the South, and will be congenial for comfortable living. 

            Master bedroom may be on the upper storey, if any, in the Southwest 

            portion of the house.  Direction of a person while sleeping also has 

            importance in Vaastu shastra. One should never sleep having head 

            towards the North Pole and legs towards the South Pole.
          </p>

          <p> However one may sleep having legs towards the West and head 

            towards the East for mental peace, good thoughts and spirituality.  
          </p>

          <p>Children room should be in the northwest or West Side. To have a 

            better concentration they should have a separate study close to their 

            bedrooms.  Location of kitchen has health implications.
          </p>

          <p>Presiding deity of the Southeast is Agni, the God of fire; hence kitchen may 

            be located  the southeast corner of the house.
          </p>

          <p>The dining room should be located in the East or the West or the North 

            near the kitchen. Northwest corner is good for perishable goods. Dinning 

            room may be in the Northwest direction, which leads to quicker 

            consumption of food. Drawing room should be preferably in the Northeast 

            or the North or the East but not in the Southwest portion of the house. 

            More vacant space should be given in the Northeast corner of the drawing 

            room.. Door is preferable on the East-towards-the-Northeast-side. 
          </p>   

          <p>While studying, one should face the North or the East or the Northeast  

            Therefore the best locations for study room are the north, east, or 

            northeast. These directions attract the positive effects of Mercury 

            increasing brain power, Jupiter increasing wisdom, Sun increasing 

            ambition and Venus helps in bringing about creativity in new thoughts 

            and ideas.  Books may be kept in the Southwest side of the room. Study 

            room may have door on the East or the North,orthe-Northeast

            As per Vaastushastra, the East is the place for the bathroom. Attached 

            bathroom may preferably be in the North, or the East of a bedroom. 

            Shower, bathing tub and wash basin in the bathroom may be in the 

            Northeast, or the North or the East direction. One may have bath in the 

            North or the East area in the bathroom. 

            Bathroom should never be constructed in the center or in the southwest 

            corner-of-the-house.
          </p>

          <p>Storeroom should be made in the Northwest or Southwest portion of the 

            house. It is very beneficial if grains and other provisions are stored in the 

            Northwest store. All heavy things should be kept in the Southwest of the 

            storeroom. Garbage may be collected in the Southern part of the house.
